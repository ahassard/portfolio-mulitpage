        <h2 >A. Hassard</h2>
        <p >Hey everyone!  My name is Ashley Hassard and I am a web designer.  As you may have
            guessed by now I am also a '<a href="https://mymodernmet.com/are-you-a-xennial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xennial</a>'. 
            I have been working full-time toward a degree in web design for the past year and a half or so and I'm expected to
            finish my degree in May 2019.</p>
        <h2 >About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Dayton, Ohio.  Started college immediately after high school
            and even had the opportunity to play collegiate softball.  Very soon into my college career I made my way to the
            local community college and became a certified firefighter/paramedic.  I finally joined the fire service when I was
            just 19.  After realizing the job market was terrible in Dayton, I made my way to Myrtle Beach, SC.  I continued my
            career there as a fire/medic.  Taking 20-28 calls in a 24-hour shift took its toll and I began to feel the <a href="https://youtu.be/tcISX0yetto" target="_blank">side
                effects</a> of burn out.</p>
        <p> During that time, I still felt a duty to serve, so I found myself enlisting in the
            United States Navy at the  <q>young age</q>  of 26 where I served honorably as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3z2p9mX4VM"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aviation Electronics Technician</a> making the rank of E-5 (Petty
            Officer Second Class) in just two years.  I had my ups and downs in the Navy, the best part was getting to see the
            world.  I lived in Atsugi, Japan for 7 months, deployed and visited Spain, France, Dubai, and Bahrain.  I am very
            proud of the time I spent in the service.</p>
        <p>      Fast forward to the last year and a half where I've gained a lot of knowledge and
            know-how in web design.  I'm currently taking classes full-time for my web design degree while working a full-time
            job in avionics.</p>
        <p>Long story short, I've learned, trained and have done quite a bit to figure out what I
            want to be when I grow up.  Some days I still think I have no idea, but right now I'm enjoying everything I'm
            learning in web design and web development.  Next up; graduation, onto a promising career, starting a family with
            my wife and then eventually moving on to an undergrad.</p>
        <h2 >The Busy Bee</h2>
        <p >Through school projects and my own 'spare' time,  I have created a lot of my own work,
            edited content, and coded from scratch.  I have created banners, logos, whipped up hand-drawn to digital images,
            edited portraits for usability, created static websites, apps, mobile/responsive sites, and server-side requests. 
            I have become more proficent in technical and SEO audits using multiple SEO tools and Google Analytics.</p>
